Description,"This unit process produces hydrogen from electricity and deionized water via alkaline electrolysis pathway.

The functional unit of the process is the production of 1 kg of hydrogen at 200 bar and 25°C with a purity of >99.9 vol%.

The gate-to-gate system boundary starts with the inputs of deionized water as feedstock and ends with the production of industrial grade of hydrogen at gate, purity of 99.9%.

The flow values are based on mass and energy balance data obtained from I-BIOREF software (https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/maps-tools-publications/publications/energy-publications/publications/i-bioref-software-modeling-and-analysis-technical-economic-and-environmental-assessment-biorefinery/17887).
The modelling of the electrolysis itself is based on kinetic modelling for the calculation of cell potential according to the Ulleberg method using semi-empirical equations (Ulleberg, 2003).

The process has a significant amount of by-product oxygen is generated in the electrolyser. It can be utilized in some real application scenarios such as those integrating the electrolysis system with an existing host site (e.g. oil refinery, bio refinery producing renewable and sustainable fuels, etc.). However, the recovery of oxygen is out of the work scope of this study, so the oxygen is assumed to be vented directly out to the atmosphere and all of the environmental impacts are allocated to hydrogen productin.",hydrogen_alkaline_electrolysis_at_plant_99_9_33_ba

Description,"The alkaline electrolysis system is the core unit of the plant, and requires electricity and deionized water as inputs. High purity deionized water produced by a water demineralization system upstream of the electrolyser is needed to achieve long-term stability. Reverse osmosis (RO) technology is often used in the water demineralization process, in which the main operation inputs are electricity and chemicals. In addition to the product of purified water, the remaining brine, which is a mixture of water and solid wastes, has to be discharged. Since the final product from the plant is hydrogen at 200 bar and 25°C with a purity of >99.9 vol%, as already described in Section 6, this hypothetical hydrogen production plant will be complemented with a compression and cooling step after the electrolyser system. In addition to the primary product of hydrogen, a significant amount of by-product oxygen is generated in the electrolyser. It can be utilized in some real application scenarios such as those integrating the electrolysis system with an existing host site (e.g. oil refinery, bio refinery producing renewable and sustainable fuels, etc.).

Description,"The PEM plant starts in the fresh input section, where deionized water is fed to the system using a centrifugal pump. Afterward, water is collected in the oxygen tank, where multiple streams converge, including the fresh water and the returns from the anode and cathode. In the oxygen tank, a gaseous stream is stripped of water and released from the overhead to produce an oxygen stream of 99.2% purity. For this, chilled water is used to lower the temperature of the oxygen to 25°C. The collected water in the oxygen tank is sent to a centrifugal pump, which then feeds to the H2O-cooler unit (in the cooling system section) to lower the temperature of the water input to the need (68°C) at the electrolyzer anode inlet.
Once in the electrolyzer, water undergoes the electrolysis reaction to produce H2 and O2, while considering a conversion of 5%. In the H2 conditioning section, the hydrogen-rich gas from the cathode side, still containing a high concentration of water (8-10%) and oxygen (800 ppm), undergoes multiple purification steps, including cooling, oxygen removal (De-oxo) and drying, to generate a product stream with a hydrogen concentration above 99.99 vol%. Before entering into the De-oxo unit, a heating step (pre-heater) is applied to the partially dried stream to the set temperature of 60°C. Meanwhile, to favor the strong adsorption of water in the molecular sieve, a cooling step using a refrigerant system (pre-cooler) is applied to reach the low temperature of 5°C. For the regeneration of the molecular sieve, water is removed in the form of steam at 250°C. After passing the colling system, the high-purity hydrogen is sent to the hydrogen compression section, where it undergoes one step of compression followed by two steps of cooling. The first step is done using an air-cooled system; meanwhile, the second step is done using chilled water (cooler). The final product is delivered at 62.3 bar and 25°C.

Description,"Plasma gas (generally hydrogen or hydrogen rich gaseous mixture) is introduced into a plasma torch to generate heat and H radicals. Plasma is mixed with feed natural gas in a plasma reactor. in the reactor, natural gas dissociates into hydrogen and carbon black. Both natural gas and plasma gas are preheated utilizing waste heat from the process. Non-contact, rapid and uniform heating at very high temperature and low pressure using plasma gas is the core of the process for hydrogen production from natural gas pyrolysis. The plasma torch uses electricity from the grid or renewables sources to generate the plasma. Carbon black quality depends on process conditions, such as temperature, mixing, residence time, plasma-feed ratio etc. Due to high endothermic nature, exit temperature of the products reduces significantly. The product is further cooled and carbon black is seperated. The heat form exit gaseous stream is recovered for pre-heating the natural gas and plasma gas streams as well as for generating electricity. Product gas is seperated from carbon black using separator. Geaseous streams then pass through cooling and compresion and hydrogen purification process. The designed process needs preheating which can be done through heat recovery of streams using several heat exchangers.

Description,"Compared to all other electrolysis systems, Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) process operates at high temperatures (600-1000℃), using steam rather than water on the anode side, and a solid electrolyte such as ceramic to conduct oxygen ions through the cell. In order to reach the operating temperature of the electrolysis cell, water is heated through a sequence of heat exchangers that use the energy of hot streams within the process, which is complemented by heat from flue gases produced in an electric boiler. The use of an electric boiler is preferred in this configuration (rather than a natural gas boiler) to fit contexts where electricity with a low-carbon intensity is available (e.g. when hydroelectricity is used).  After steam is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen ions, gaseous hydrogen leaves the electrolysis cell at the cathode side, while the oxygen gas moves trough the SOEC and leaves on the anode side. 

Steam dissociation requires less energy than water, and electricity consumption by the SOEC is lower compared to other technologies, for similar capacities. In this process configuration, air is used as sweep gas to displace the oxygen from the anode channel. Moreover, it is used as a heating medium to convey heat between the cathode and the anode. 

Hydrogen exiting the SOEC is cooled in the heat exhanger network, and part of its water content is removed to be recirculated to the feedwater section. The hydrogen stream then goes through a refrigerated dryer, a twin tower desiccant dryer, and a series of compressor to reach its final specification at 99.99% purity, 325 °C and 65 bar.

The technology is still at R&D development, so not enough information available for simulations, durability or costs (TRL: 7 vs 9 for AE and PEM).",hydrogen_soec_electrolysis_with_electric_boiler_op

Description,"Compared to all other electrolysis systems, Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) process operates at high temperatures (600-1000℃), using steam rather than water on the anode side, and a solid electrolyte such as ceramic to conduct oxygen ions through the cell. In order to reach the operating temperature of the electrolysis cell, water is heated through a sequence of heat exchangers that use the energy of hot streams within the process, which is complemented by heat from flue gases produced in a hydrogen fed boiler. The use of hydrogen as fuel is preferred in this configuration (rather than a natural gas) in order to minimize GHG emissions associated to the process, thus lowering the carbon footprint of the hydrogen product. In this process configuration, the capacity of the SOEC cell needs to be increase to include the additional hydrogen required for energy needs. This implies higher amounts of feedwater to the process and higher electricity consumed at the SOEC; therefore such configuration fits better with contexts where electricity with a low-carbon intensity is available (e.g. when hydroelectricity is used).  After steam is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen ions, gaseous hydrogen leaves the electrolysis cell at the cathode side, while the oxygen gas moves trough the SOEC and leaves on the anode side. 

Steam dissociation requires less energy than water, and electricity consumption by the SOEC is lower compared to other technologies, for similar capacities. In this process configuration, air is used as sweep gas to displace the oxygen from the anode channel. Moreover, it is used as a heating medium to convey heat between the cathode and the anode. 

Hydrogen exiting the SOEC is cooled in the heat exhanger network, and part of its water content is removed to be recirculated to the feedwater section. The hydrogen stream then goes through a refrigerated dryer, a twin tower desiccant dryer, and a series of compressor to reach its final specification at 99.99% purity, 325 °C and 65 bar.

The technology is still at R&D development, so not enough information available for simulations, durability or costs (TRL: 7 vs 9 for AE and PEM).",hydrogen_soec_electrolysis_with_hydrogen_combustio

Description,"A zinc-oxide sulfur-guard bed was used to remove 98% of the sulfur in the feed, resulting in a maximum sulfur content of 0.1 ppm post-sulfur guard bed. The clean gas – generally referred to as sweet gas – is rich in methane and therefore reformed in the pre-reformer using steam as a reforming agent and in the presence of a Nickel-Alumina (Ni (15%) –Al2O3 (85%)) in the reformer. Steam used in pre-reformer is produced by heat recovery from combustion flue gases (after gaining heat from syngas). Steam reforming as an endothermic reaction requires heating energy, which is provided by combusting process off-gases from the downstream Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) unit, as well as natural gas as fuel. Methane as well as other alkanes are transformed into syngas components via the reforming process and exit the reactor at a high temperature (above 900 C) which passes through a heat recovery unit system to exchange their heat, cool down somewhat and produce steam. The product gas passes through three Water-Gas-Shift (WGS) reaction steps. The WGS hydrogen-adjusted product goes through an adsorption process within the PSA unit, where hydrogen gas is separated. Finally, hydrogen gas is compressed using medium pressure compressors to 60 bar followed by cooling to reach the storage conditions. The emissions from this SMR process are off-gases from the reforming unit, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) that are completely emitted to the air. The carbon capture and sequestration unit (CCS) process is excluded from this pathway system boundary.
